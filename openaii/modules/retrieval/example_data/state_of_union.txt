The "State of the Union" refers to an annual address delivered by the President of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress.
Typically given in January or February, this speech serves as an opportunity for the President to report on the current condition of
the nation, outline policy proposals, and articulate a vision for the future.

During the State of the Union address, the President often reflects on the events and achievements of the past year,
discusses domestic and foreign policies, economic conditions, social issues, national defense, and diplomatic priorities.
The speech is a significant political event and a chance for the President to communicate their perspective on the state of
the country and policy goals to both Congress and the American public.

The State of the Union is a constitutional obligation outlined in the United States Constitution,

where the President is required to periodically inform Congress and the nation about the state of affairs.
This tradition has been a longstanding part of American political and institutional practice.
